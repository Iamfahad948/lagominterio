          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>
            At Lagom Interiors, we believe that good design doesn't have to be complicated. Our philosophy is 
            based on the Swedish concept of "lagom," which means "just the right amount." This principle 
            guides everything we do, from our design process to the materials we use. We take a collaborative 
            approach to design, working closely with our clients to understand their needs and preferences. 
            Our team is committed to delivering exceptional results on every project, no matter how big or small.
