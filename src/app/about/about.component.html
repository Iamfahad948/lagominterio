          <h2>About Lagom</h2>
          <p>At Lagom Interiors, we believe that good design doesn't have to be complicated. Our philosophy is based on the Swedish concept of "lagom," which means "just the right amount." This principle guides everything we do, from our design process to the materials we use.</p>
          <p>We take a collaborative approach to design, working closely with our clients to understand their needs and preferences. Our team is committed to delivering exceptional results on every project, no matter how big or small.</p>
